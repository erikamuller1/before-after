    <h1><span class="header">Then</span> and <span class="header"> Now</span>: What your favorite Disney Channel stars are doing today</h1>

    <div id="byline">By Erika Muller Dec. 10, 2019</div>

<hr>
    <p>Picture this: it’s 2006, you run off the school bus straight to the living room and turn on the Disney Channel. What are you seeing? You're probably watching Raven look into the future, Zach and Cody run around the Tipton or Hannah Montana singing “The Best of Both Worlds”.</p>


    <p>If you turn on the TV now, what you will see about these stars is much different than what you saw in 2006. Some have been arrested, went to rehab, released a new album, came out with a blockbuster movie or sadly, are no longer with us.</p>


    <p>Here are past Disney Channel stars: the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
<hr>
    <h2> Orlando Brown </h2>
