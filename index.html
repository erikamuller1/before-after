  <p>Picture this: it’s 2006, you run off the school bus straight to the living room and turn on the Disney Channel. What are you seeing? You're probably watching Raven look into the future, Zach and Cody run around the Tipton or Hannah Montana singing “The Best of Both Worlds”.


    If you turn on the TV now, what you will see about these stars is much different than what you saw in 2006. Some have been arrested, went to rehab, released a new album, came out with a blockbuster movie or sadly, are no longer with us.


    Here are past Disney Channel stars: the good, the bad and the ugly.

     Now: In 2018, Brown was arrested for an outstanding warrant for his arrest after his girlfriend filed assault charged against him in 2016. In December 2018, Brown appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil where he talked about his drug addiction.
     After Dr. Phil suggested he seek treatment for his addiction, Brown responded by saying “it’s a slap in the face to people that actually need it”.

     According to Celebrity Net Worth, Orlando Brown is worth $20,000.
